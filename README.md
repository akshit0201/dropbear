## About

Dropbear is a [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) based programming language. The test for various features are written in  [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started).

To code in Dropbear just type
`npm run` in the terminal inside the root directory.

`npm link` command inside the root directory can globalize the language on the local machine. The user can then type `dropbear` to access the CLI.

At the moment basic arthimetic operations and variable assignment are supported.

Example:

`(add 5 (subtract 2 1))` returns 6

`(set x 5)` sets x to 5

The given language is written in JavaScript and can be transpiled to JavaScript using Babel.
